# Image-Processing-Translation-and-Rotation-with-CUDA-Programming
## **Program Name**  
Image Translation and Rotation Program using CUDA Programming.  

## **Program Function**  
This program performs translation and rotation on an image specified in the program code. It rotates the downloaded image by 90Â° and applies translation or shifting. The program utilizes CUDA to execute the rotation and translation processes, enabling faster execution. By leveraging GPU programming, which can handle multiple processes simultaneously, the image is divided into smaller parts processed by multiple threads concurrently, making it significantly faster compared to using a CPU.
